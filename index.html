                <p>Consumer Protection</p>
                <p>Consumer protection is the practice of safeguarding buyers of goods and services,<br> and the public, against unfair practices in the marketplace. Consumer protection<br> measures are often established by law. Such laws are intended to prevent<br> businesses from engaging in fraud or specified unfair practices in order<br> to gain an advantage over competitors or to mislead consumers.<br> They may also provide additional protection for the general public which may<br> be impacted by a product (or its production) even when they are not the direct<br> purchaser or consumer of that product. For example, government regulations may require<br> businesses to disclose detailed information about their productsâ€”particularly<br> in areas where public health or safety is an issue, such as with food or automobiles.</p>

                <p>Know Your Rights</p>
                <p>Knowing your comsumer rights is an important thing because<br>
                you might get cheated from buying non quality products and you<br>
            suffer from a disease if you buy a product that is unofficial.</p>
